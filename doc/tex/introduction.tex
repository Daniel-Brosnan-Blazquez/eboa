\item Explicit reference: identifier referring to an entity business-related
\item Event: period of time associated to a gauge of a certain aspect business-related
\item Annotation: particular aspect associated to an explicit reference
\item Input: block of information received from the external interface to process. After the processing, the interesting information is extracted and stored inside the system.

\item Report: container of analysis.

\end{itemize}
