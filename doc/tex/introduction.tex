\acrshort{gsdm} is the component aimed to serve as data storage management for the ground segment information. The component aims to allow a dynamic data structure for reducing the effort of developing data models and managing the complex relations between data received.

All the information received is stored into the database using the following high-level entities:

\begin{itemize}

\item Explicit reference: identifier referring to an entity related to information of the ground segment
\item Event: period of time associated to a gauge of a certain aspect of the ground segment
\item Annotation: particular aspect associated to an explicit reference
\item Input: block of information received from the external interface to process. After the processing, the interesting information is extracted and stored inside the system.

\end{itemize}
