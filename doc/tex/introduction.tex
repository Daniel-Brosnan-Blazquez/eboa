\acrshort{eboa} is the component aimed to serve as data storage management for business operation analysis. The component aims to allow a dynamic data structure for reducing the effort of developing data models and managing the complex relations between data received.

All the information received is stored into the database using the following high-level entities:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Explicit reference}: identifier referring to an entity business-related
\item \textbf{Event}: period of time associated to a gauge of a certain aspect business-related
\item \textbf{Annotation}: particular aspect associated to an explicit reference
\item \textbf{Source}: block of information received from the external interface/s to process. After the processing, the interesting information is extracted and stored inside the system.
\item \textbf{Alert}: notification to users regarding anomalies identified by the system related to previous entities.
\item \textbf{Report}: container of analysis.

\end{itemize}
