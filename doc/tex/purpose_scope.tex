\chapter{Purpose and scope}

This component manages the storage of the data received following the next requirements:

\begin{itemize} 

\item Traceability of all the data to the source of information (even information created within the infrastructure)

\item No pre-configuration needed for inserting data

\item Include modern datatypes for storing the data

\item Flexible structure for linking information to events and annotations

\item Flexible structure for linking events between them

\item Flexible structure for linking explicit references between them

\item Continuous developtment/Continuous integration approach

\item Include geo-query functionalities

\item Parallel insertion of data using the \acrshort{rdbms} parallelism mechanisms

\item Quick access to the information by which it can be managed dynamically depending on the needs of the users

\end{itemize}

The scope of this component targets systems/tools with the need of storing time-tagged information. The data model used allows quick access to the information in a structured way.
